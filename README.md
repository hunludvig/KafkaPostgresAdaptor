# KafkaPostgresAdaptor
Playing with Kafka, PostgreSQL, Spring Boot and unit tests with embedded Kafka and HSQLDB

This simple Spring Boot application demonstrates how to set up a Kafka producer, consumer and a CRUD repository to PostgreSQL.

The Unit and integration tests use embedded Kafka from Spring and in memory DB HSQLDB (Postgres flavoured).
